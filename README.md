homesick-server
===============

The server side to the Homesick app.

The meat of the Homesick App project will take place here.

The user will record and upload audio from their mobile device to the server, which will process and categorize the type of noise.

At the moment, I've set up a test environment for learning. I hope to have a Node.js-based server that can accept files via a HTTP POST request.
